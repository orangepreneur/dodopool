## DodoPool is a simple dark VSCode theme inspired by DeadPool characters.

I was looking for a read and black combination theme for VSCode for a really long time. After spending some time and trying so many themes, I decided to create my own version of it.

It may not be perfect so please bear with me I will be updating it time to time.
